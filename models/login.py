# Writes down text steps for logging in
    # each time it is called it generates next_steps.json
    # if there are no steps to execute, the next_steps.json should be empty

# The logic
    # Ask user to input login credentials and to press login button
    # This step need to be done manually by the user,
    # so here in next steps a logic for Selenium would be to wait for the user input

# return => next_steps.json
